				Our History
			</p>
		</h2>
		
		<h0>
			<p style="text-align:center">
				Our History started in the horrible year of 2020. More precisely it was October 14th. It was me and Luke being bored and talking about game development and how great of an idea it would be to start our own game development studio.
			</p>
			
			<p style="text-align:center">
				Eepi already had game development and programming background. Then it started. It used to be EL Games as Luke really wanted for it to be called that. It was already taken though and that name would drown in to the ocean of all the other "EL Games".
			</p style="text-align:center">
			
			<p style="text-align:center">
				The new name needed to be unique. After a while of thinking Eepi got it... "ScrewsLoose Games" indicating the Screws of Sanity being loose in our heads. It took us a while to decide between "Games", or "Studios" and we went with games. We were called ScrewsLoose Games for a long time but then came the frustration of never getting any projects of games done.

				Our Buried projects
			</p>
		</h2>
		
		<h0>
			<p style="text-align:center">
				We have multiple buried projects. Perhaps the one we made the most and the most popular one, "CubeFight". CubeFight was a platformer with guns and action and poor level design. It was made with the original "Gamemaker Studio 1", we buried it later on though. The earlier versions can still be downloaded though; However CubeFight was not our first project. There was a wide RPG called "Castle Game" at the time. It took place in the early 1400's but was buried after the game never working out. It was a wide project though. Then there was one of our most worked on games. "The Mind Game" was a game that would mess with you. It, like Castle Game was made in Unity. This was our first 3D game, and it was heavily inspired by the 2017 masterpiece, Prey. We worked on it for a pretty long time but then unity broke down and we never saw the project in a working order. These aren't the only buried projects, but these are the most famous ones.
